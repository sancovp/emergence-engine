## Notation Breakdown

### Phase Notation: `(N)[PhaseName]`
- **(N)**: Phase number (0-6)
- **[PhaseName]**: Descriptive name of the phase
- Example: `(1)[SystemsDesign]` = Phase 1: Systems Design

### Sub-step Notation: `(Na)[SubstepName]`
- **(Na)**: Phase number + letter (a-l)
- **[SubstepName]**: Specific activity
- Example: `(1a)[PurposeCapture]` = First substep of Phase 1

### Flow Notation: `→`
- Indicates sequential progression
- Everything flows left to right, top to bottom
- Sub-steps flow within their phase

### Loop Notation: `loop→(0)`
- System returns to Phase 0 with new understanding
- Each loop refines and improves the system
- Not a simple repeat - it's a spiral of improvement

## Reading Strategies

### 1. **Linear Reading** (First Time)
Start at (0) and follow arrows through (6), understanding each phase's purpose.

### 2. **Phase-Focused Reading**
Pick one phase (e.g., SystemsDesign) and deeply understand all its sub-steps.

### 3. **Pass-Based Reading**
- Pass 1: Read all phases thinking "what IS this thing?"
- Pass 2: Read all phases thinking "how do we MAKE these?"
- Pass 3: Read all phases thinking "how do we make THIS ONE?"

## Key Interpretive Principles

### 1. **Context Dependency**
Each step's meaning depends on:
- Which pass you're on (1, 2, or 3)
- What you're designing (domain)
- Your current understanding level

### 2. **Recursive Application**
The workflow can be applied:
- To the entire system
- To individual components
- To sub-components
- Even to the workflow itself

### 3. **Flexible Depth**
Not every substep needs equal attention:
- Some may be quick checks
- Others require deep analysis
- Context determines depth

## Example: Reading Phase 1 in Different Passes

### Pass 1 (Conceptual): "What IS an autobiography?"
- (1a) PurposeCapture: Why do autobiographies exist?
- (1b) ContextMap: What cultural role do they play?
- (1c) StakeholderGoals: Who cares about autobiographies?

### Pass 2 (General): "How do we MAKE autobiography generators?"
- (1a) PurposeCapture: Why build a generator system?
- (1b) ContextMap: What technical context exists?
- (1c) StakeholderGoals: Who will use the generator?

### Pass 3 (Specific): "How do we generate JANE'S autobiography?"
- (1a) PurposeCapture: Why does Jane want an autobiography?
- (1b) ContextMap: What's Jane's situation?
- (1c) StakeholderGoals: Who will read Jane's story?

## Common Misunderstandings

### 1. **It's Not a Waterfall**
Though sequential, you can:
- Jump back to earlier phases
- Work on multiple phases simultaneously
- Skip irrelevant substeps

### 2. **DSL Doesn't Mean Code**
Domain-Specific Language means:
- The vocabulary of your domain
- Concepts and relationships
- NOT programming syntax

### 3. **Phases Build on Each Other**
- Phase 1 output feeds Phase 2
- Can't architect what you haven't designed
- Can't build what you haven't architected
