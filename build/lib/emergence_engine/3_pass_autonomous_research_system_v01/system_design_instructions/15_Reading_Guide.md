## Quick Decision Tree

```
Are you new to the workflow?
    Yes → Start with Path 1
    No ↓

    No ↓
    
Are you interested in theory?
    Yes → Go to Path 3
    No ↓

## Reading Tips

1. **Don't read everything at once** - Pick a path and follow it
2. **The three-pass concept is crucial** - Make sure you understand it
3. **Examples help** - Look at the restaurant reservation example
4. **Practice beats theory** - Try applying it to something simple
5. **Confusion is normal** - We started confused too!

## Remember

The goal isn't to memorize the workflow but to internalize the thinking pattern:

**Understand deeply → Build systematically → Create specifically → Evolve continuously**

Happy reading!
