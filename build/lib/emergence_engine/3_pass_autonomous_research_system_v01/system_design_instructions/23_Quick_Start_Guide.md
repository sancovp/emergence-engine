# Quick Start: Apply the Recursive Evolution Pattern

## You Have 5 Minutes? Here's What You Need

### The Core Pattern
```
1. Understand deeply (Pass 1: What IS it?)
2. Build systematically (Pass 2: How MAKE them?)  
3. Create specifically (Pass 3: Make THIS one)
4. Check: Can this instance become a new type?
5. If yes: Go to step 1 with the instance as your new subject
```

### When Confused
```
Ask yourself:
- Am I mixing "What it IS" with "What it DOES"?
- Am I confusing the type with an instance?
- Do I see how the definition guides implementation?

Fix these → Understanding emerges
```

### The Workflow Tool
Use this for EACH pass:
```
(0)[Goal]→(1)[Design]→(2)[Architecture]→(3)[Language]→
(4)[Network]→(5)[Build]→(6)[Feedback]→loop→(0)
```

## Immediate Action Steps

### For Your Current Project

1. **Identify what you're building**
   - Write: "X is..." (not "X does...")
   - List essential properties
   - Draw boundaries (what it's NOT)

2. **Design the generator**
   - What system creates these?
   - What are the components?
   - How do they connect?

3. **Build one instance**
   - Make it concrete
   - Test it works
   - Document what you learned

4. **Look for evolution**
   - Is this instance special?
   - Could it become a pattern?
   - Should you build a generator for this pattern?

## The Power Move

**Turn every good solution into a reusable pattern:**
```
Your Solution (instance)
    ↓ "What made this work?"
Your Approach (pattern)
    ↓ "How can others use this?"
Your Method (generator)
    ↓ "What variations exist?"
Your Framework (meta-pattern)
```

## Examples in 30 Seconds

### Software Feature
1. What IS this feature? (user value, not code)
2. How do we MAKE features like this? (pattern)
3. Build THIS feature (implementation)
4. Extract the pattern for reuse

### Business Process
1. What IS this process? (transformation, not steps)
2. How do we DESIGN such processes? (method)
3. Design THIS process (specific)
4. Create process template for variants

### Learning Something
1. What IS this knowledge? (concepts, not facts)
2. How does one ACQUIRE this? (learning method)
3. Learn THIS instance (actual learning)
4. Create learning guide for others

## The Meta-Cheat Sheet

```python
def evolve_anything(thing):
    # Pass 1: Understand
    essence = conceptualize(thing)  # What IS it?
    
    # Pass 2: Systematize  
    generator = design_generator(essence)  # How MAKE them?
    
    # Pass 3: Instantiate
    instance = generator.create()  # Make THIS one
    
    # Evolution check
    if instance.has_novel_pattern():
        return evolve_anything(instance)  # RECURSE!
    
    return instance
```

## The Only Three Questions

For anything you're working on:
1. **Do I understand what this IS?** (not what it does)
2. **Do I have a systematic way to create these?**
3. **Does my instance reveal new patterns?**

If any answer is "no", you know where to focus.

## Start Now

1. Pick something you're working on
2. Ask: "What IS this?" (Pass 1)
3. Apply the workflow to understand it deeply
4. Build systematically (Pass 2)
5. Create your instance (Pass 3)
6. Watch for emergent patterns
7. Evolve

Remember: **Every good instance can become a new type.**

## The 60-Second Version

```
Confused? → Separate IS from DOES → Understand types
Understand? → Three passes → Check for patterns
Found pattern? → Extract it → Make it reusable
Made reusable? → You've evolved your system

Repeat forever.
```

## The Ultimate Shortcut

**The recursive evolution pattern means:**
- Your solutions can become methods
- Your methods can become frameworks  
- Your frameworks can become principles
- Your principles can spawn new domains

Start with any problem. End with universal solutions.

This is the way.
