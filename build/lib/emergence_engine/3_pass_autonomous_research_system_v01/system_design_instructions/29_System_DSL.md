# System Design DSL: Unified Notation for Recursive Systems

## Core Notation

### Pass Notation
```
P₁ = Pass 1 (Conceptualize/What IS)
P₂ = Pass 2 (Generally Reify/How MAKE)  
P₃ = Pass 3 (Specifically Reify/Make THIS)
```

### Layer Notation
```
L₀ = Base layer (first application)
L₁ = First recursive layer (P₃ of L₀ becomes P₁ of L₁)
L₂ = Second recursive layer
...
Lₙ = nth recursive layer
```

### Complete Pass Reference
```
L₀P₁ = Layer 0, Pass 1 (What IS X?)
L₀P₂ = Layer 0, Pass 2 (How MAKE X?)
L₀P₃ = Layer 0, Pass 3 (Make this X)

L₁P₁ = Layer 1, Pass 1 (What IS this specific X instance?)
L₁P₂ = Layer 1, Pass 2 (How MAKE things like this X?)
L₁P₃ = Layer 1, Pass 3 (Make instance of X-type)
```

### Workflow Reference
```
W[n] = Workflow applied at layer n
W[0] = Base workflow application
W[0](0→6) = Full workflow at base layer
W[0](3) = Just phase 3 (DSL) of workflow at base layer
```

### Meta-Framework Levels
```
M⁰ = Object level (the thing itself)
M¹ = Meta level (framework for the thing)
M² = Meta-meta level (framework for frameworks)
M³ = Meta-meta-meta level
...
Mⁿ = nth meta level
```

### State Notation
```
S:C = State: Confusion
S:U = State: Understanding
S:C→U = Transition from Confusion to Understanding
```

### Complete System Reference
```
Σ = The complete system including all components
Σ[L₀] = System at layer 0
Σ[L₁] = System at layer 1
Σ[M²] = System at meta-meta level
```

## Composition Notation

### Sequential Application
```
L₀P₁ → L₀P₂ → L₀P₃
"Apply all three passes in sequence at layer 0"
```

### Recursive Transition
```
L₀P₃ ↦ L₁P₁
"Output of Layer 0 Pass 3 becomes input to Layer 1 Pass 1"
```

### Meta-Level Transition
```
L₀ ⇒ M¹[L₀]
"Layer 0 understanding creates Meta-framework for Layer 0"
```

### Complete Cycle
```
Σ: L₀(P₁→P₂→P₃) ↦ L₁(P₁→P₂→P₃) ↦ ... ⇒ Mⁿ
"System executes layers recursively until meta-level n"
```

## Practical Examples

### Autobiography System Journey
```
L₀P₁: What IS an autobiography?
L₀P₂: How do we MAKE autobiography generators?
L₀P₃: Create autobiography generator instance

L₁P₁: What IS this generator? (study it as type)
L₁P₂: How do we MAKE similar generators?
L₁P₃: Create specialized generator

M¹: Meta-framework emerges (how we learned this)
M²: Meta-meta emerges (universal pattern)
```

### Referencing Our Documents
```
Doc02 = P₁₋₃ explanation (all passes)
Doc16 = M¹ (meta-framework)
Doc20 = M² principles (meta-meta)
Doc13 = S:C→U journey (our confusion to understanding)
```

## Operators

### Recursion Operator
```
R[X] = Apply X to itself
R[L₀P₃] = Apply (L₀P₃) to itself as new type
```

### Evolution Operator
```
E[X] = X evolves through use
E[L₀] = Layer 0 evolves into multiple specialized versions
```

### Understanding Operator
```
U[X] = Understanding of X
U[L₀] < U[L₁] < U[L₂] (monotonic increase)
```

## Communication Examples

### Concise Statements
```
"We applied L₀(P₁₋₃) to get our generator"
"The jump from L₀P₃ ↦ L₁P₁ revealed new patterns"
"M² contains the universal principle"
"Our S:C→U used W[0]→W[1]→M¹"
```

### Complex Descriptions
```
"Σ evolved through L₀→L₁→L₂ revealing M¹ at L₁ and M² at L₂"
"Each Lₙ contains complete P₁₋₃ using W[n]"
"The pattern Lₙ₋₁P₃ ↦ LₙP₁ creates infinite depth"
```

## Quick Reference Card

```
PASSES          LAYERS          META-LEVELS     STATES
P₁ = What IS    L₀ = Base       M⁰ = Object     S:C = Confusion
P₂ = How MAKE   L₁ = First      M¹ = Meta       S:U = Understanding  
P₃ = Make THIS  L₂ = Second     M² = Meta-meta  S:C→U = Transition
                Lₙ = nth        Mⁿ = nth meta   

OPERATORS                       WORKFLOW
→ = Sequential                  W[n] = Workflow at layer n
↦ = Recursive transition        W[n](x) = Phase x at layer n
⇒ = Meta emergence             W[n](0→6) = Full workflow
R[X] = Recursion of X          
E[X] = Evolution of X          SYSTEM
U[X] = Understanding of X      Σ = Complete system
                               Σ[Lₙ] = System at layer n
                               Σ[Mⁿ] = System at meta-level n
```

## Using the DSL

### To Describe Where You Are
```
"I'm at L₀P₁ trying to understand what IS my domain"
"I'm in S:C about how L₁P₂ works"
"I've reached M¹ understanding"
```

### To Describe Processes
```
"Apply R[L₀P₃] to discover L₁"
"Use W[0](0→6) for each pass"
"E[L₀] produced three specialized variants"
```

### To Reference Concepts
```
"The L₀P₃ ↦ L₁P₁ transition is key"
"M² explains why R[X] works universally"
"S:C→U requires ontological thinking"
```

## The Power of This DSL

Now we can say things like:
- "The autobiography system went from L₀ to L₂, revealing M² principles"
- "Every P₃ output can undergo R[X] to create new Lₙ₊₁"
- "Our confusion was resolved by understanding that P₁ ≠ implementation"
- "The pattern applies at any Mⁿ level"

This DSL itself is a P₃ output that could become L₁P₁!
