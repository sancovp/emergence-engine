- Resolution: 5-10% (Closure)

### Attention Weights:
- High Drama Episodes: Heavy weight (reader attention peaks)
- Transitional Passages: Light weight (maintain flow)
- Reflective Passages: Medium weight (process meaning)
- Descriptive Passages: Light weight (provide context)

### Emotional Weights:
- Peak Moments: Maximum weight
- Daily Life: Baseline weight
- Transitions: Minimal weight
- Revelations: High weight

## 4e. Simulation

### Reading Path Simulations:

**Linear Reader Path**:
- Follows chronological spine strictly
- Start → Chapter 1 → Chapter 2 → ... → End
- Time: Cover to cover

**Thematic Reader Path**:
- Jumps between thematically related episodes
- Love stories → Career challenges → Family themes
- Non-linear exploration

**Reference Reader Path**:
- Seeks specific information
- Index → Specific episode → Related episodes
- Targeted reading

### Narrative Flow Dynamics:
- Tension builds through challenge accumulation
- Release comes through transformation/achievement
- Reflection provides breathing space
- Patterns create recognition/satisfaction

## 4f. Load Balance

### Pacing Balance:
- **Heavy Episodes**: Major events, high drama
- **Light Episodes**: Daily life, transitions
- **Mix Strategy**: Heavy-Light-Heavy-Light rhythm

### Emotional Balance:
- **High Intensity**: Crisis, triumph, loss
- **Low Intensity**: Routine, description
- **Recovery Time**: Space between intense episodes

### Thematic Balance:
- **Major Themes**: 3-5 primary threads
- **Minor Themes**: Supporting patterns
- **Distribution**: Themes interwoven, not clustered

### Temporal Balance:
- **Life Phase Coverage**: Proportional to significance
- **Not Equal**: More weight on formative/transformative
- **Compression**: Some periods summarized

## 4g. Topology Map

### Final Topology Structure:

**Architecture Type**: Hierarchical Narrative Network
- Primary: Chronological sequence
- Secondary: Thematic connections
- Tertiary: Reflective overlays

**Flow Characteristics**:
1. **Forward Momentum**: Time arrow drives progress
2. **Recursive Depth**: Reflection loops add layers
3. **Thematic Bridging**: Connections across time
4. **Emotional Peaks/Valleys**: Dynamic engagement

**Critical Paths**:
1. **Spine Path**: Origin → Formation → Transformation → Resolution
2. **Growth Path**: Challenge → Struggle → Breakthrough → Integration
3. **Meaning Path**: Event → Reflection → Insight → Wisdom

**Structural Integrity Points**:
- Opening must hook and establish contract
- Each era must advance overall arc
- Themes must resolve or evolve
- Ending must satisfy narrative promises

**Reader Navigation**:
- Clear chapter/section breaks
- Temporal markers throughout
- Thematic callbacks and forwards
- Reflective bridges between past/present

This topology ensures the autobiography functions as a coherent system where every component serves the whole, creating a satisfying journey from beginning to end while allowing for complex interconnections between life elements.
