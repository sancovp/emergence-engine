# Phase 0: Abstract Goal

## The Autobiography as a System

**Abstract Goal**: An autobiography is a self-authored narrative system that captures, structures, and communicates the essence of a lived human experience through interconnected components of memory, meaning, and time.

**What It Is**: A complex artifact that transforms raw life experiences into a coherent, meaningful narrative that can be understood by others and preserved across time.

**Core Purpose**: To create a bridge between the internal experience of a life lived and the external understanding of that life by others (including the future self).
