## 2c. Interface Definition

### Reader Interfaces:
- **Entry Point**: Preface/introduction - why this story
- **Navigation**: Table of contents, chapter breaks
- **Orientation**: Time/place markers, context setting
- **Exit Point**: Conclusion/epilogue - what it means

### Component Interfaces:
```
Episodes ←→ Timeline
- Episodes must fit within chronological framework
- Timeline provides context for each episode

Characters ←→ Episodes  
- Characters appear within episodes
- Episodes develop characters over time

Themes ←→ Episodes
- Themes emerge from episode patterns
- Episodes illustrate themes concretely

Voice ←→ All Components
- Voice permeates every element
- All elements must align with voice

Reflection ←→ Episodes
- Reflection comments on episodes
- Episodes prompt reflection
```

```

## 2g. Redundancy Plan

- **Temporal Redundancy**: Multiple time markers (age, year, era)
- **Thematic Redundancy**: Themes reinforced across episodes
- **Perspective Redundancy**: Past-self vs. present-self views
- **Truth Redundancy**: Multiple sources/perspectives on events

## 2h. Architecture Specification

### Key Architectural Principles:

1. **Chronological Backbone**: Time provides primary structure
2. **Thematic Weaving**: Themes run through chronology like threads
3. **Episodic Modularity**: Each episode semi-independent but connected
4. **Voice Consistency**: Unified perspective throughout
5. **Reflective Duality**: Past experience + present understanding

### Structural Patterns:

**Linear Progressive**: Birth → Present in sequence
**Thematic Clustering**: Grouped by theme, not time
**Pivotal Moments**: Organized around key turning points
**Parallel Tracks**: Multiple life aspects in parallel
**Spiral Return**: Revisiting times/themes with deeper insight

### Quality Attributes:
- **Coherence**: All parts serve the whole
- **Completeness**: Sufficient coverage of life
- **Authenticity**: True to lived experience
- **Accessibility**: Readable and engaging
- **Durability**: Meaningful across time
