# Phase 1: Systems Design - Autobiography Generator

## 1a. Purpose Capture
The system transforms human memories into structured autobiographies by:
- **Eliciting**: Drawing out memories through guided conversation
- **Organizing**: Structuring memories into coherent timeline
- **Analyzing**: Extracting themes and patterns
- **Generating**: Creating narrative prose
- **Preserving**: Maintaining authentic voice

## 1b. Context Map
- **User Context**: People wanting to preserve life stories
- **Technical Context**: LLM-based agents with tool calling
- **Cultural Context**: Respecting diverse narrative traditions
- **Temporal Context**: Capturing past for future

## 1c. Stakeholder Goals
- **User**: Share story easily, see life patterns, create legacy
- **Family**: Receive well-structured, readable narrative
- **System**: Efficiently process and generate content
- **Agents**: Complete specialized tasks successfully

## 1d. Success Metrics
- Memory collection completeness (coverage of life phases)
- Theme extraction accuracy (meaningful patterns found)
- Voice preservation score (authenticity maintained)
- Narrative coherence (readable, flowing text)
- User satisfaction (story feels "right")

## 1e. Constraint Scan
- **Technical**: Agent.run() interface, tool calling patterns
- **Memory**: Limited context windows for agents
- **Quality**: Maintaining coherence across chapters
- **Time**: Reasonable generation time
- **Accuracy**: Respecting user's truth

## 1f. Resource Limits
- Agent calls: Minimize for efficiency
- Memory storage: Efficient data structures
- Processing time: Stream where possible
- Context size: Chunk large operations

## 1g. Regulatory Bounds
- Privacy: User owns all content
- Data protection: Secure memory storage
- Content rights: User retains copyright
- Ethical: No fabrication of memories

## 1h. Risk Assumptions
- **Incomplete memories**: System handles gaps gracefully
- **Contradictions**: Agents detect and query
- **Emotional content**: Sensitive handling
- **Technical failures**: Checkpointing for recovery

## 1i. Concept Model
```
User Story
    ↓
Memory Collection ← Interview Agent
    ↓
Raw Memories
    ↓
Structure Analysis ← Timeline + Theme Agents  
    ↓
Organized Content
    ↓
Narrative Generation ← Narrative + Voice Agents
    ↓
Complete Autobiography
```

## 1j. Ontology Mapping to Pass 1
- **Memories** → Episodes in autobiography
- **Life Phases** → Chapters/Eras
- **Themes** → Thematic threads
- **Voice Profile** → Consistent tone
- **Relationships** → Character system

## 1k. Boundary Set
**In Scope**:
- Memory elicitation through conversation
- Chronological organization
- Theme and pattern extraction
- Narrative prose generation
- Voice consistency

**Out of Scope**:
- Fact checking external sources
- Photo/document integration
- Multiple perspectives
- Fiction writing
- Real-time collaboration

## 1l. Design Brief
Create a multi-agent system where specialized agents work together to transform a person's memories into a complete autobiography. Each agent uses LLM capabilities through the agent.run() interface, with tools for specific operations. The system follows the autobiography ontology from Pass 1, instantiating each component type through agent interactions.
