# Master Prompt: How to Use the Systems Design Workflow

## The Complete Framing Prompt

When you encounter the systems design workflow notation, here's how to interpret and use it effectively:

```
You are about to use a powerful systems design workflow that guides you through building complex systems using ontological thinking and iterative refinement. This workflow is expressed as:

(0)[AbstractGoal]→(1)[SystemsDesign→(1a)[PurposeCapture]→(1b)[ContextMap]→(1c)[StakeholderGoals]→(1d)[SuccessMetrics]→(1e)[ConstraintScan]→(1f)[ResourceLimits]→(1g)[RegulatoryBounds]→(1h)[RiskAssumptions]→(1i)[ConceptModel]→(1j)[OntologySketch]→(1k)[BoundarySet]→(1l)[DesignBrief]]→(2)[SystemsArchitecture→(2a)[FunctionDecomposition]→(2b)[ModuleGrouping]→(2c)[InterfaceDefinition]→(2d)[LayerStack]→(2e)[ControlFlow]→(2f)[DataFlow]→(2g)[RedundancyPlan]→(2h)[ArchitectureSpec]]→(3)[DSL→(3a)[ConceptTokenize]→(3b)[SyntaxDefine]→(3c)[SemanticRules]→(3d)[OperatorSet]→(3e)[ValidationTests]→(3f)[DSLSpec]]→(4)[Topology→(4a)[NodeIdentify]→(4b)[EdgeMapping]→(4c)[FlowWeights]→(4d)[GraphBuild]→(4e)[Simulation]→(4f)[LoadBalance]→(4g)[TopologyMap]]→(5)[EngineeredSystem→(5a)[ResourceAllocate]→(5b)[PrototypeBuild]→(5c)[IntegrationTest]→(5d)[Deploy]→(5e)[Monitor]→(5f)[StressTest]→(5g)[OperationalSystem]]→(6)[FeedbackLoop→(6a)[TelemetryCapture]→(6b)[AnomalyDetection]→(6c)[DriftAnalysis]→(6d)[ConstraintRefit]→(6e)[DSLAdjust]→(6f)[ArchitecturePatch]→(6g)[TopologyRewire]→(6h)[Redeploy]→(6i)[GoalAlignmentCheck]]→loop→(0)

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: This workflow should be applied in THREE PASSES:

PASS 1 - CONCEPTUALIZE (Ontological/Universal Level):
- Question: "What IS the thing I'm designing?"
- Focus: Understanding the essential nature, components, and relationships in your domain
- Output: Complete ontological model of your domain
- Mindset: You're a philosopher/scientist studying the fundamental nature of things
- Example: "What IS an autobiography?" (not how to write one, but what makes something an autobiography)

PASS 2 - GENERALLY REIFY (General/Class Level):
- Question: "How do I BUILD systems that create these things?"
- Focus: Designing the generator/factory/system that can produce instances
- Output: A system capable of creating domain instances
- Mindset: You're an engineer building a production system
- Example: "How do I build an autobiography generator?" (the system, not a specific autobiography)

PASS 3 - SPECIFICALLY REIFY (Specific/Instance Level):
- Question: "How do I create THIS PARTICULAR instance?"
- Focus: Using the system to generate a specific instance
- Output: A concrete, specific instance
- Mindset: You're an operator using the system
- Example: "How do I generate Jane Doe's autobiography?" (a specific person's specific story)

KEY PRINCIPLES:

1. ONTOLOGICAL THINKING FIRST: In Pass 1, resist ALL urges to think about implementation. Focus purely on understanding WHAT things are, not HOW to build them.

2. DSL MEANS VOCABULARY, NOT SYNTAX: The Domain-Specific Language phase is about identifying the concepts and relationships in your domain, NOT creating a programming language with parsers.

3. EACH PHASE BUILDS ON THE PREVIOUS: You cannot architect (Phase 2) what you haven't designed (Phase 1). The output of each phase feeds the next.

4. THE WORKFLOW IS FRACTAL: You can apply this same workflow to the entire system, to individual components, or even to features within components.

5. ITERATION IS EXPECTED: The "loop→(0)" means you'll refine your understanding with each pass. Your second time through will be deeper than your first.

6. ADAPT TO YOUR CONTEXT: While the workflow provides structure, adapt the depth and focus of each phase to your specific needs. Some phases may need deep diving, others just a quick check.

HOW TO USE:

1. First, decide which pass you're on (1, 2, or 3)
2. Start at Phase 0 with the appropriate mindset for your pass
3. Work through each phase and substep, interpreting them through your pass's lens
4. Document your work for each phase before moving to the next
5. When you complete Phase 6, loop back to Phase 0 with your new understanding
6. Repeat until you have a working system that meets your goals

REMEMBER:
- Pass 1 is about understanding the domain ontologically
- Pass 2 is about building systems that can create instances
- Pass 3 is about creating specific instances
- Each pass through the workflow deepens your understanding
- Keep domain thinking separate from implementation thinking
- The goal is systematic completeness, not rigid adherence

Now, begin with Phase 0 of Pass 1 by stating what domain you're working in and what you're trying to understand ontologically.
```

## How to Use This Framing Prompt

### 1. **When to Use It**
- Starting a new systems design project
- Teaching someone the workflow
- Resetting when you've gotten confused
- Documenting your approach for others

### 2. **How to Customize**
Replace the example domain (autobiography) with your specific domain while keeping the structure and principles intact.

### 3. **Key Sections to Emphasize**

#### For Beginners:
- The three-pass structure
- The difference between passes
- Common pitfalls (especially DSL confusion)

#### For Experienced Users:
- The fractal nature
- Adaptation principles
- Iteration expectations

### 4. **Usage Patterns**

#### Solo Design Work:
Read the framing prompt, then work through each pass systematically, referring back when needed.

#### Team Design Work:
Share the framing prompt with all team members, agree on which pass you're working on, then proceed together.

#### Teaching/Mentoring:
Use the framing prompt to introduce the concept, then work through a simple example together.

## The Meta-Insight

This framing prompt itself follows the workflow:
- It starts with an abstract goal (understanding how to use the workflow)
- It provides systematic design (the three-pass structure)
- It defines the DSL (vocabulary like "pass," "ontological," "reify")
- It maps the topology (how phases connect)
- It engineers understanding (concrete instructions)
- It includes feedback loops (iteration and adaptation)

## Final Note

The power of this workflow lies not in rigid adherence but in systematic thinking. Use this framing prompt to establish the right mindset, then let the workflow guide you toward building better systems through deep understanding.

Remember: **First understand what you're building, then figure out how to build it, then actually build it.** This sequence, repeated with increasing sophistication, leads to robust and well-designed systems.
