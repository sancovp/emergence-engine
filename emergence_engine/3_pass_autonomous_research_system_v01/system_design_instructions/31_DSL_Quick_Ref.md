# DSL Quick Reference

## Essential Notation

### Passes & Layers
```
P₁, P₂, P₃ = The three passes
L₀, L₁, L₂, Lₙ = Recursive layers (L₀ is base)
L₀P₁ = "Layer 0, Pass 1"
```

### Key Transitions
```
→ = Sequential (P₁ → P₂ → P₃)
↦ = Recursive (L₀P₃ ↦ L₁P₁)
⇒ = Meta emergence
```

### Meta Levels
```
M⁰ = Object level
M¹ = Meta-framework  
M² = Meta-meta (universal)
Mⁿ = nth meta level
```

## Common Expressions

```
"We discovered M² through L₀→L₁→L₂"
"Each P₃ can ↦ to become next L's P₁"
"Our S:C→U happened at L₁"
"The system Σ contains all Lₙ and Mⁿ"
```

## Our Journey in DSL

```
L₀P₁: What IS autobiography?
L₀P₂: How MAKE generators?
L₀P₃: Built generator
L₁P₁: What IS this generator?
L₁P₂: How MAKE such systems?
⇒ M¹: Meta-framework emerges
⇒ M²: Universal principle
```

## Quick Translations

| Long Form | DSL |
|-----------|-----|
| "Pass 1 of our first attempt" | L₀P₁ |
| "When the instance became a type" | L₀P₃ ↦ L₁P₁ |
| "The meta-framework" | M¹ |
| "Universal recursive principle" | M² |
| "Apply recursively" | R[X] |
| "State of confusion" | S:C |
