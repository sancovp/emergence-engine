# Phase 3: Domain Specific Language for Autobiographies

## 3a. Concept Tokenize

### Temporal Concepts:
- **Moment**: Specific point in time (birth, graduation, wedding)
- **Period**: Extended timeframe (childhood, the war years, my thirties)
- **Era**: Major life phase (student years, career, retirement)
- **Sequence**: Order of events (first, then, afterwards, finally)
- **Duration**: Length of time (brief, extended, lifelong)

### Narrative Concepts:
- **Episode**: Complete story unit with beginning/middle/end
- **Scene**: Specific place/time/action within episode
- **Transition**: Bridge between episodes or periods
- **Flashback**: Non-linear return to earlier time
- **Foreshadowing**: Hint at future events

### Character Concepts:
- **Protagonist**: The author/self at different life stages
- **Mentor**: Influential guide figure
- **Companion**: Peer/partner in journey
- **Adversary**: Source of conflict/challenge
- **Catalyst**: Person who triggers change

### Thematic Concepts:
- **Journey**: Progress from one state to another
- **Transformation**: Fundamental change in self
- **Pattern**: Recurring element across episodes
- **Lesson**: Wisdom gained from experience
- **Motif**: Symbolic recurring element

### Emotional Concepts:
- **Tone**: Overall emotional color (nostalgic, triumphant, melancholic)
- **Mood**: Emotional atmosphere of episode
- **Tension**: Conflict or uncertainty
- **Resolution**: Emotional completion
- **Revelation**: Moment of understanding

## 3b. Syntax Define

### Basic Autobiography Grammar:

**Life Structure**:
```
Autobiography = Preface + Chronology + Epilogue
Chronology = Era+
Era = Chapter+
Chapter = Episode+
Episode = Scene+ + Reflection
```

**Narrative Patterns**:
```
Coming-of-Age = Innocence → Challenge → Growth → Maturity
Overcoming = Stability → Crisis → Struggle → Victory
Discovery = Ignorance → Questioning → Seeking → Finding
Loss-and-Recovery = Having → Losing → Grieving → Rebuilding
```

**Temporal Patterns**:
```
Linear: A → B → C → D
Circular: A → B → C → A'
Spiraling: A → B → C → A+ → B+ → C+
Branching: A → (B|C) → D
```

**Reflective Patterns**:
```
Then-Now: "At the time I thought... Now I understand..."
Causal: "This happened because... Which led to..."
Significance: "This mattered because... It shaped..."
```

## 3c. Semantic Rules

### Coherence Rules:
- Every Episode must connect to at least one Theme
- Characters introduced must have clear relationships to Protagonist
- Time progression must be trackable (even if non-linear)
- Reflections must emerge from Episodes, not exist in isolation

### Authenticity Rules:
- Voice must remain consistent across temporal distance
- Emotional truth takes precedence over factual precision
- Perspective must acknowledge its limitations
- Growth must feel earned, not proclaimed

### Completeness Rules:
- Major life phases require representation
- Significant relationships need development
- Central themes require multiple illustrations
- Arc must have discernible trajectory

## 3d. Operator Set

### Narrative Operators:
- **Sequence**: Episode A THEN Episode B
- **Parallel**: Episode A WHILE Episode B  
- **Causation**: Episode A CAUSES Episode B
- **Contrast**: Episode A BUT Episode B
- **Echo**: Episode A RHYMES-WITH Episode B

### Temporal Operators:
- **Locate**: WHEN (specific time placement)
- **Duration**: FOR (time extent)
- **Recurrence**: REPEATEDLY (pattern over time)
- **Simultaneity**: MEANWHILE (parallel time)

### Thematic Operators:
- **Emergence**: Theme EMERGES-FROM Episodes
- **Development**: Theme DEEPENS-THROUGH Episodes
- **Resolution**: Theme RESOLVES-IN Episode
- **Tension**: Theme1 CONFLICTS-WITH Theme2

### Character Operators:
- **Introduction**: Character ENTERS-IN Episode
- **Development**: Character EVOLVES-THROUGH Episodes
- **Relationship**: Character1 RELATES-TO Character2 AS Role
- **Exit**: Character DEPARTS-IN Episode

## 3e. Validation Tests

### Structural Validation:
- Does the autobiography have clear beginning/middle/end?
- Are transitions between episodes smooth?
- Is chronology traceable even if non-linear?
- Do chapters form coherent units?

### Thematic Validation:
- Are themes introduced and developed?
- Do themes emerge from episodes naturally?
- Is there thematic resolution or insight?
- Are patterns recognized and articulated?

### Voice Validation:
- Is voice consistent throughout?
- Does voice match claimed perspective?
- Are reflections integrated naturally?
- Is tone appropriate to content?

### Completeness Validation:
- Are major life phases represented?
- Are significant relationships explored?
- Are promises made in preface fulfilled?
- Does conclusion satisfyingly complete arc?

## 3f. DSL Specification

### Autobiography Components:

**Essential Elements**:
1. **Temporal Backbone**: Chronological structure
2. **Episode Collection**: Story units
3. **Character Ensemble**: People in the life
4. **Thematic Threads**: Meaning patterns
5. **Reflective Commentary**: Interpretive layer
6. **Voice Container**: Unifying perspective

**Compositional Rules**:
1. Episodes must serve larger narrative arc
2. Characters must have clear story function
3. Themes must emerge from concrete episodes
4. Reflection must illuminate, not dominate
5. Voice must remain authentic throughout

**Genre Markers**:
- First-person narration
- Truth claims (non-fiction)
- Retrospective perspective
- Personal experience focus
- Life-span coverage

### Narrative Equations:
```
Autobiography = Life Events + Reflection + Voice
Episode = Event + Context + Significance  
Character = Role + Relationship + Impact
Theme = Pattern + Meaning + Evolution
Arc = Beginning State → Transformation → End State
```

This DSL provides the conceptual vocabulary for understanding and constructing autobiographies as narrative systems, defining what elements must be present and how they relate to create a coherent life story.
