# Phase 1: Systems Design of an Autobiography

## 1a. Purpose Capture
An autobiography serves to:
- **Document**: Preserve life experiences in structured form
- **Interpret**: Provide meaning and context to events
- **Connect**: Create understanding between author and reader
- **Reflect**: Enable self-understanding through narrative construction
- **Legacy**: Transmit wisdom, values, and history to future generations

## 1b. Context Map
- **Temporal Context**: Spans from birth (or before) to present/death
- **Cultural Context**: Embedded in specific cultural narrative traditions
- **Social Context**: Positions individual within family, community, history
- **Literary Context**: Exists within genre conventions and reader expectations
- **Personal Context**: Unique to individual's experiences and perspective

## 1c. Stakeholder Goals
- **Author**: Tell their truth, be understood, leave legacy
- **Primary Readers** (family/friends): Understand loved one better
- **Secondary Readers** (public): Learn, relate, be inspired
- **Future Readers**: Access historical/personal record
- **The Subject** (author's past self): Be accurately represented

## 1d. Success Metrics for an Autobiography
- **Completeness**: Coverage of significant life periods
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and thematic consistency  
- **Authenticity**: True to author's voice and experience
- **Insight**: Depth of reflection and self-understanding
- **Engagement**: Reader connection and comprehension
- **Preservation**: Durability of record over time

## 1e. Constraint Scan
- **Memory Constraints**: Limited/imperfect recall
- **Narrative Constraints**: Linear text vs. non-linear experience
- **Length Constraints**: Finite space vs. infinite experience
- **Privacy Constraints**: Self-censorship, protecting others
- **Truth Constraints**: Subjective memory vs. objective facts
- **Structural Constraints**: Beginning/middle/end requirements

## 1f. Resource Limits
- **Author Resources**: Time, energy, memory, writing skill
- **Material Resources**: Medium (paper/digital), space/length
- **Cognitive Resources**: Reader attention span
- **Emotional Resources**: Ability to process difficult content

## 1g. Regulatory Bounds
- **Legal**: Libel, privacy laws, copyright
- **Ethical**: Truth-telling, consent of those mentioned
- **Cultural**: Narrative conventions, taboos
- **Genre**: Autobiography vs. memoir vs. fiction boundaries

## 1h. Risk Assumptions
- **Incompleteness Risk**: Important events forgotten/omitted
- **Misrepresentation Risk**: False or distorted memories
- **Harm Risk**: Damage to relationships through revelation
- **Misunderstanding Risk**: Reader misinterprets intent
- **Permanence Risk**: Written record fixes fluid identity

## 1i. Concept Model
Core concepts that comprise an autobiography:
- **Chronology**: The temporal backbone
- **Episodes**: Discrete story units (events, periods)
- **Characters**: People who appear in the life
- **Themes**: Recurring patterns of meaning
- **Voice**: The author's unique perspective/style
- **Arc**: Overall trajectory of the life story
- **Reflection**: Meta-commentary on experiences

## 1k. Boundary Set
**Included in an Autobiography**:
- First-person narrative
- Lived experiences of author
- Reflection and interpretation
- Chronological organization (even if non-linear)
- Truth claims (vs. fiction)

**Excluded from an Autobiography**:
- Others' stories (except as they intersect)
- Pure fiction
- Objective historical record
- Complete factual accuracy
- Every life detail

## 1l. Design Brief
An autobiography is a narrative system that transforms lived experience into communicable meaning. It must balance completeness with selectivity, truth with narrative coherence, and self-revelation with privacy. The design must accommodate the non-linear nature of memory within a linear narrative structure, preserve authentic voice while ensuring readability, and create a record that serves both contemporary readers and historical preservation. The autobiography should emerge as more than the sum of its episodes - it should reveal patterns, growth, and meaning that weren't necessarily apparent during the living.
