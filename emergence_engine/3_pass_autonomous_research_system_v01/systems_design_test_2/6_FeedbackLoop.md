### Continuous Life Cycle:

```
while (autobiography_exists) {
    reader_feedback = collect_responses()
    cultural_changes = analyze_context_drift()
    
    if (significant_drift_detected) {
        new_edition = prepare_update(
            new_preface,
            annotations,
            corrections,
            contemporary_context
        )
        
        if (author_available) {
            add_new_epilogue()
            include_reflection_on_response()
        } else {
            add_scholarly_introduction()
            include_historical_significance()
        }
        
        redeploy(new_edition)
    }
    
    preserve_in_new_formats()
    extend_reach_to_new_audiences()
    maintain_relevance()
}
```

The autobiography thus becomes not a static artifact but a living document that continues to evolve, finding new readers, revealing new meanings, and serving its essential function of preserving and transmitting human experience across time and culture. The feedback loop ensures the autobiography remains vital and accessible even as the world changes around it.
