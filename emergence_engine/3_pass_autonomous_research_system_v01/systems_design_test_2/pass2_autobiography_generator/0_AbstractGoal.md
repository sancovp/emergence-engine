# Phase 0: Abstract Goal - Autobiography Generator System

## Core Goal

Create a multi-agent system that can instantiate the autobiography ontology defined in Pass 1, transforming a person's raw life experiences into a coherent, well-structured autobiography that follows the patterns and principles we've established.

## System Vision

A conversational AI system that:
- Guides users through memory elicitation
- Organizes experiences into the defined structure
- Extracts themes and patterns
- Generates narrative content
- Maintains authentic voice
- Produces a complete autobiography

## Key Transformation

**Input**: Person with memories and experiences
**Process**: Multi-agent orchestration following Pass 1 ontology
**Output**: Complete autobiography as defined in Pass 1
