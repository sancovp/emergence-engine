# Pass 1 Visual Summary: Autobiography as System

## The Three-Pass Concept

```
PASS 1: CONCEPTUALIZE (What IS an autobiography?)
   ↓
   Autobiography = Temporal Structure + Narrative Content + 
                   Character System + Meaning Layer + Voice
   ↓
   Ontology defined, architecture mapped, topology established

PASS 2: GENERALLY REIFY (How do we MAKE autobiographies?)
   ↓
   Multi-Agent System that can:
   - Interview people for memories
   - Organize temporal structures  
   - Extract themes and patterns
   - Generate narrative content
   - Maintain consistent voice
   ↓
   System that instantiates the Pass 1 ontology

PASS 3: SPECIFICALLY REIFY (Make THIS autobiography)
   ↓
   Interview Jane Doe →
   Her memories + Her timeline + Her themes →
   Generate "Jane Doe: A Life Story"
   ↓
   Concrete instance following Pass 1 patterns using Pass 2 system
```

## What We Learned About Autobiographies (Pass 1)

### It's Not Just Memories in Order!

An autobiography is a **complex system** with:

```
COMPONENTS
   Episodes ←→ Themes
      ↓         ↓
Timeline ←→ Meaning
      ↓         ↓
   Voice ←→ Readers
```

### The DSL is Conceptual, Not Code

Instead of: `MEMORY @year{1975} {...}` ❌

We defined: 
- What a "memory" IS (episodic unit with temporal location)
- How memories RELATE to themes (emergence, illustration)
- What PATTERNS exist (coming-of-age, transformation)

### Architecture Matters

Like a building:
- **Foundation**: Voice (must be consistent throughout)
- **Structure**: Chronology (holds everything up)
- **Rooms**: Episodes (where life happens)
- **Decoration**: Themes (what gives meaning)
- **Windows**: Reflections (letting light in)

### It's a Living System

Through feedback loops:
```
Original Book → Readers → Feedback →
   ↓
Updated Edition (annotations, new preface) →
   ↓
New Format (audiobook, digital) →
   ↓
Cultural Document (historical value)
```

## The Power of This Approach

By treating autobiography as a system in Pass 1, we:

1. **Understand its complexity** - not just "write down memories"
2. **Define quality** - what makes a good autobiography
3. **Enable generation** - Pass 2 knows what to build
4. **Ensure completeness** - all components accounted for

Now Pass 2 can build a system that creates autobiographies with confidence, knowing exactly what the end product should be!
