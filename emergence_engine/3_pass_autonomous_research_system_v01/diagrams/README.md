# Compound Intelligence System Topology Diagrams

These diagrams provide the essential topology map for navigating the compound intelligence system effectively.

## Core Understanding (Read in Order):

### 1. `01_core_biphasic_topology.md` - The Fundamental Pattern
**The WHAT**: Every conversation follows a biphasic loop (Dev â†’ Implement) operating at global and local levels with verification gates.

### 2. `02_tool_activation_sequence.md` - Operating the Pattern  
**The HOW**: Which tools activate when to execute the biphasic pattern using STARSHIP, STARLOG, 3-Pass, GIINT, etc.

### 3. `03_traditional_3pass_9passes_nested.md` - The Complete Systematic Method
**The DEPTH**: The 9-pass system showing how Layer 2 creates generators that manage their own generator work.

## Purpose:
These diagrams should be part of LLM system prompts to provide the topology map needed to make high-level navigation decisions in the compound intelligence ecosystem.

- Part of EmergenceEngine MCP via view_mechanics() tool
- Essential context for understanding where you are in the overall flow
- Decision tree for knowing which tool to reach for next

## Integration:
- **Copy the text from [here](https://github.com/sancovp/emergence-engine/blob/master/emergence_engine/3_pass_autonomous_research_system_v01/diagrams/00_complete_system_topology.md) to the system prompt of the agent you are using.**
