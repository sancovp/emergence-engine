# Implementation Roadmap: Building the Self-Evolving System

## Overview

We're building a system that can evolve its own ability to help LLMs design systems. This requires careful staging to manage complexity.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Basic Agent Framework
```python
# Simple agent interface
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, llm_client, system_prompt):
        self.llm = llm_client
        self.prompt = system_prompt
    
    def execute(self, input_data):
        # Basic LLM call with prompt
        pass
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Agent base class
- [ ] LLM interface abstraction
- [ ] Basic state management
- [ ] Simple message passing

### 1.2 Three-Pass Implementation
```python
# Hardcode the original workflow first
DEFAULT_WORKFLOW = """
(0)[AbstractGoal]→(1)[SystemsDesign]→(2)[SystemsArchitecture]→
(3)[DSL]→(4)[Topology]→(5)[EngineeredSystem]→(6)[FeedbackLoop]→loop→(0)
"""

# Implement the three passes
pass1_agent = Agent(llm, PASS1_PROMPT + DEFAULT_WORKFLOW)
pass2_agent = Agent(llm, PASS2_PROMPT + DEFAULT_WORKFLOW)
pass3_agent = Agent(llm, PASS3_PROMPT + DEFAULT_WORKFLOW)
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Pass 1 Agent (Conceptualizer)
- [ ] Pass 2 Agent (System Builder)
- [ ] Pass 3 Agent (Instance Creator)
- [ ] Basic orchestration

### 1.3 Test Harness
```python
# Can we build a simple system?
result = three_pass_system.build("todo app")
assert result.has_ontology()
assert result.has_code()
assert result.has_instance()
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Test suite for 3-pass system
- [ ] Quality metrics
- [ ] Baseline measurements

## Phase 2: Understanding Loop (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 State Detection
```python
class UnderstandingManager:
    def detect_state(self, agent_output):
        # Analyze output for confusion markers
        if "unclear" in output or "confused" in output:
            return "CONFUSION"
        return "UNDERSTANDING"
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Confusion detection
- [ ] Understanding verification
- [ ] State transitions

### 2.2 Correction Mechanisms
```python
class CorrectionAgent:
    def correct_confusion(self, confusion_context):
        # Apply ontological thinking
        # Separate IS from DOES
        # Clarify types vs instances
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Correction agent
- [ ] Ontological thinking prompts
- [ ] Feedback loops

### 2.3 Integration
Connect understanding loop with 3-pass system

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Integrated understanding + 3-pass
- [ ] State persistence
- [ ] Loop completion detection

## Phase 3: Workflow Variability (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Workflow Injection
```python
class ThreePassSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.workflow = None  # Now variable!
    
    def set_workflow(self, workflow_structure):
        self.workflow = workflow_structure
        self.update_all_agents()
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Variable workflow support
- [ ] Agent prompt regeneration
- [ ] Workflow validation

### 3.2 Variation Generation
```python
class WorkflowMutator:
    def mutate(self, workflow):
        # Add/remove phases
        # Reorder steps
        # Modify descriptions
        return mutated_workflow
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Mutation operators
- [ ] Crossover functions
- [ ] Variation constraints

## Phase 4: Evolution Engine (Week 7-8)

### 4.1 Fitness Evaluation
```python
class FitnessEvaluator:
    def score(self, workflow_variant, test_results):
        return {
            'speed': time_to_complete,
            'quality': output_quality_score,
            'completeness': coverage_score,
            'insights': meta_discovery_count
        }
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Fitness metrics
- [ ] Automated scoring
- [ ] Multi-objective optimization

### 4.2 Evolution Loop
```python
class EvolutionEngine:
    def evolve(self, population, generations):
        for gen in range(generations):
            # Test all variants
            # Score fitness
            # Select best
            # Generate offspring
            # Repeat
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Evolution controller

# Web UI for exploration
http://localhost:8080/experiments
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] CLI tool
- [ ] Web dashboard

### Phase 3 Success
- System accepts any valid workflow structure
- Different workflows produce different outputs
- No degradation from workflow switching

### Phase 4 Success
- Evolution discovers improved workflows

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **LLM Rate Limits**: Implement caching and batching
- **Quality Variance**: Multiple runs and averaging
- **Infinite Loops**: Timeout and circuit breakers

### Research Risks
- **No Improvement Found**: Analyze why, pivot approach
- **Overfitting**: Cross-domain validation
- **Complexity Explosion**: Constraints on variations

## Next Steps

1. **Set up development environment**
2. **Create GitHub repo with this structure**
3. **Implement Phase 1.1 (Basic Agent Framework)**
4. **Test with simple example**
5. **Iterate based on learnings**

## The Vision

In 12 weeks, we'll have a system that:
- Automatically discovers better ways to help LLMs build systems
- Learns from its own confusion and successes
- Evolves increasingly sophisticated approaches
- Provides insights into LLM capabilities and limitations

This is the beginning of self-improving AI tools.
