# System Design Roadmap: Building a Self-Evolving AI System

## What We're Building

A research system that scientifically discovers optimal workflows for helping LLMs build systems.

### How It Works
```python
# First run - test with default or custom workflow
result = research.run(description="task manager")
print(f"Score: {result.score}, ID: {result.system_id}")

# Evolve based on learnings
result2 = research.run(system_id=result.system_id)
print(f"Improved by: {result2.improvement_delta}")
```

### Key Features
1. **Scientific Method**: Every run has hypothesis → experiment → conclusions
2. **Automatic Evolution**: Learns from results and evolves workflows
3. **Complete Tracking**: Full lineage and history of improvements
4. **3-Pass Execution**: Every experiment builds a real system
5. **Knowledge Accumulation**: Gets smarter with each use

## Why This Matters

We discovered that the entire system_design_instructions framework (30+ documents of insights) was generated in just 10 minutes by giving Claude a workflow prompt + the 3-pass system.

This means we can:
- **Automate** the discovery of better prompting strategies
- **Evolve** optimal workflows for different domains
- **Scale** prompt engineering beyond human limitations
- **Discover** emergent capabilities we didn't expect

## The Architecture

### Three Nested Loops
1. **Research Loop** (Outer): Tests different workflow variants
2. **Understanding Loop** (Middle): Handles confusion and builds understanding  
3. **Three-Pass System** (Inner): Actually builds the systems

### The Agents
- **Orchestrator**: Manages everything
- **Research Controller**: Runs experiments
- **Understanding Manager**: Detects/fixes confusion
- **Pass 1/2/3 Agents**: Execute the three passes
- **Reflection Agent**: Analyzes results
- **Evolution Agent**: Creates new variants

## Quick Start Path

### Option 1: Just Want to See It Work? (1 day)
Read [03_Quick_Start.md](03_Quick_Start.md) - Build a proof of concept in hours

### Option 2: Want to Build the Full System? (12 weeks)
Read [02_Implementation_Roadmap.md](02_Implementation_Roadmap.md) - Complete development plan

### Option 3: Want to Understand the Architecture? 
- [01_System_Architecture.md](01_System_Architecture.md) - Technical details
- [04_Visual_Architecture.md](04_Visual_Architecture.md) - Visual diagrams

## The Core Innovation

**The workflow structure becomes a VARIABLE that evolution can optimize:**

```python
# Instead of:
hardcoded_workflow = "(0)→(1)→(2)→(3)"

# We have:
variable_workflow = evolve_for_best_performance()
```

This means the system can discover entirely new ways to help LLMs build systems.

## What Success Looks Like

### Week 1
- Basic 3-pass system working
- Can swap different workflows
- Measurable quality differences

### Month 1  
- Understanding loop prevents failures
- Evolution finding better workflows
- Clear improvements over baseline

### Month 3
- Fully autonomous system
- Discovering domain-specific optimizations
- Generating insights about LLM capabilities

### The Ultimate Goal
A system that gets better at helping LLMs build systems every time it's used.

## The Research Questions

1. **What workflow structures work best for different domains?**
2. **Can evolution discover patterns humans haven't thought of?**
3. **How much can we improve LLM system-building capabilities?**
4. **What emergent behaviors appear in evolved workflows?**

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Read the Complete Vision (5 minutes)
# 2. Try the Quick Start code examples
# 3. Run your first experiment:

from research_system import ResearchSystem

research = ResearchSystem(llm_client)
result = research.run(description="blog platform")

print(f"Hypothesis: {result.hypothesis}")
print(f"Score: {result.score}")
print(f"Conclusions: {result.conclusions}")
print(f"Next: research.run(system_id='{result.system_id}')")
```

## The Philosophical Depth

We're not just building a tool. We're creating:
- A system that improves its own improvement process
- A framework that discovers new frameworks
- An evolution engine for conceptual tools
- A path toward self-improving AI systems

## Join the Journey

This roadmap is the beginning. As we build this system:
- New patterns will emerge
- Better architectures will be discovered
- The roadmap itself will evolve

Because that's what this system does - it makes everything, including itself, better.
