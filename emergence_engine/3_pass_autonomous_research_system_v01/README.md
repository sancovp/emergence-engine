# 3-Pass Autonomous Research System

## Reading Order

First read **system_design_instructions**. Then read **system_design_test_2**. Then read **system_design_research**. Then read **system_design_roadmap**.

### What You'll Discover

1. **system_design_instructions** - The foundational framework and its recursive depths
2. **system_design_test_2** - The framework applied to build an autobiography system
3. **system_design_research** - The discovery that we can evolve the framework itself
4. **system_design_roadmap** - The blueprint for building a self-improving research system

Each directory builds on the previous, revealing deeper layers of the recursive pattern.

The journey: Framework → Application → Evolution → Implementation
